# Input & Output
The communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system.

* Python 
* JavaScript
* C++

Now we see examples of how to take input and how to display output in these programming languages.

## Python
When we need some thing to display as output, we use "print" function for display that specific information.
```python print_function
print("Hello World") 
```
```python output
Output: Hello World
```
## JavaScript
In javascript when we need to display something like 'hello world' we use "console.log" function for display the 'hello world'.
```javascript print function
console.log("hello world");
```
```javascript output
Output: hello world
```
## C++
In c++ when we need to print something like 'hello world' we use "cout" function for print the 'hello world'
```c++ print_function
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
```c++ output
Output: Hello World!
```
****************************************************************
# Variables
A variable is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item.

* Python 
* Javascript 
* C++

Now here we discuss about variables how to use initialize variables, take input variables and show them as a output in different languages.

## Python 
Python has no command for declaring a variable. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```python variables
x=50         //integer type
y="Ruhi"    //string type
print(x)   //print the value which is store in variable x
print(y)  //print the value which is store in variable y
```
```
Output: 50
        Ruhi
```
